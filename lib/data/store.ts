// The `DataStore` interface — the data-access seam. `./index.ts` is the single place that
// wires the concrete implementation: as of issue #45 that's `DrizzleDataStore` (shared
// Postgres, lib/db/drizzle-store.ts) reached through the Server Actions boundary
// (lib/server/actions.ts); the localStorage store is retired for the deployed app, kept
// only as a reference impl + test double.
//
// This seam localizes *which store* is active to one file — but it is NOT a "swap one line"
// boundary, despite earlier framing. Moving off localStorage forced the store server-side,
// which meant standing up the Server Actions boundary AND rewiring the (previously
// client-only) call sites to await it. Treat a store change as "pick the impl in index.ts +
// reconcile the client/server split," not a single-line edit.
//
// Data model the seam carries (extended for Topic Page v1 — see types.ts and
// docs/design/topic-page-v1.md §14):
//   - Topic: qid (canonical key), title, description.
//   - Clip (curated): media + creator fields, orientation, general/sectionSlug,
//     contextNote, stance(+modifier), accuracyFlag(+modifier), upvotes, curatedBy.
//   - Candidate (unvetted, empty state): same media/creator fields, vetted:false,
//     source + matchReason; NO stance/accuracy/contextNote (CURATION §6).
// Topic-level counts (videos/creators/curators) are DERIVED from clips by the
// caller, not stored, so they can never drift from the clip set.
